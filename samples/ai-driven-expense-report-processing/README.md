## Minimal path to awesome

### Using the solution zip

**Step 1: Import the solution into your Power Apps environment**

* [Download](./solution/ai-driven-expense-report-processing-sample.zip) the `.zip` from the `solution` folder.
* Within **Power Apps Studio**, import the solution `.zip` file using **Solutions** > **Import Solution** and select the `.zip` file you've just downloaded.
* Once the solution has been imported, you will see the **Automated Expense Reporting** solution under the **Unmanaged** section of the **Solutions** page.
* Select the solution to open it.

**Step 2: Configure the Expense Category table**

* In the solution explorer, look for the **Expense Category** table > Select the **Commands** icon > **Open** > **Open in new tab** to open the table.
* Select **Edit** on the top toolbar to open the table in edit mode.
* Configure the table to show the **Category Name** and **Category Description** columns.
* Insert the following records into the table:
  | Category Name | Category Description      |
  | -------------- | ------------- |
  | Airfare | Covers the cost of domestic and international flights for business travel. |
  | Ground Transportation | Covers local transportation costs for business-related travel, including taxis, rideshare services, shuttles, and car rentals. |
  | Hotel | Covers lodging expenses for business travel, including nightly stays at hotels, motels, or corporate housing. |
  | Meals | Covers meal expenses incurred during business travel or client meetings. |
  | Parking | Covers parking fees incurred during business-related activities, including airport parking, hotel parking, and client site visits. |

**Step 3: Test the Analyze Incoming Expense Reports flow**

* In the solution explorer, look for the **Analyze Incoming Expense Reports** flow > Select the **Commands** icon > **Edit** > **Edit in new tab** to open the flow.
* Switch to the **New designer**
* **Publish** and **Test** the flow
  * After selecting **Test** >  **Manually** > **Test**.
* Open Outlook in a new tab and send an email to yourself with the following details:
  * **Subject**: *New Expense Report*
  * **Body**: Write a lengthy description of where you went, what you did, etc
  * **Attachment**: Attach multiple receipt images (e.g., a picture of a restaurant bill or a hotel invoice) to the email.

* Check the **Expense Report** and **Expense** tables in Dataverse to see if the flow has created the records successfully.


### Using the source code

You can also use the [Power Apps CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli) to pack the source code by following these steps:

* Clone the repository to a local drive
* Pack the source files back into a solution `.zip` file:

  ```bash
  pac solution pack --zipfile pathtodestinationfile --folder pathtosourcefolder --processCanvasApps
  ```

  Making sure to replace `pathtosourcefolder` to point to the path to this sample's `sourcecode` folder, and `pathtodestinationfile` to point to the path of this solution's `.zip` file (located under the `solution` folder)
* Within **Power Apps Studio**, import the solution `.zip` file using **Solutions** > **Import Solution** and select the `.zip` file you just packed.
* Once completed, follow along from **Step 2** above.

## Features

This sample showcases an AI-driven expense report processing solution that combines an AI Builder prompt, Dataverse, and Power Automate.

The AI Prompt uses both text and image (multi-modal) input as well as Dataverse grounding:

The prompt is then used in a Power Automate flow to automate the Expense Report processing. The flow is triggered by an incoming email, from which it extracts the senderâ€™s details and initializes an **Expense Report** Dataverse record:

The flow continues to analyze the email body and any attached receipt images to determine the purpose of the expense and extract individual expense details. For each receipt, it creates a corresponding record in the **Expense** Dataverse table, uploads the receipt image, and updates running totals:

Once the flow processes all receipts, it updates the **Expense Report** record with the purpose, total amount and status:
