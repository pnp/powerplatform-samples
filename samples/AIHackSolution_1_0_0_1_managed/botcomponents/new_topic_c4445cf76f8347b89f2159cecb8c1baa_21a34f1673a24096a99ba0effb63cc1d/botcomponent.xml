  <description>Lesson 2 - This lesson will show you how you can create a simple topic with one conditional branch and a variable.

A variable is a name for an item which will be used later in the topic flow.  In this example, "pva_StoreLocation" is the name for the variable when you ask the user for their preferred Store Location.</description>
