  <description>Lesson 3 - This lesson will show you how you can create a simple topic with one conditional branch, variable, and entity.

When you use entities in your topic, the bot can identify key information in what the user types and proactively fill in that information in your variables. For example, if the customer says "I want to buy a red car," you don't need to ask them which color car, because the bot recognizes the Color entity in what they typed. The bot will then skip the question where you asked for color. 

You can also use entities to recognize a specific list of options. In this lesson, we identify State as the entity, and the bot will recognize any US state the user types.</description>
