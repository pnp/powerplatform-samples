            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As a Microsoft Certified Professional and Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, I currently serve as a Power Platform & Dynamics 365 Associate Consultant at Cloud Surge. My dedication lies in delivering practical and user-friendly solutions, and I have a strong enthusiasm for learning and sharing knowledge. Active in the community, I find joy in helping others solve problems and have started sharing my learnings on my blog.

In terms of qualifications, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Business & Information Technology at Virtual University. After completing my Intermediate in Computer Sciences in 2021, I chose to focus on enhancing my skills and career. I ventured into Microsoft Power Platform immediately after my Intermediate, and I have successfully obtained several certifications, including PL-900, MB-910, PL-100, PL-200, MB-210, and PL-400.

In my role, I am responsible for understanding client requirements and providing practical and user-friendly solutions using Power Platform, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365. My primary skills revolve around Microsoft Power Platform, especially Canvas Apps, as well as Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365. Additionally, I have expertise in Graphics Designing and Networking.

As a fan and enabler of Microsoft Technologies, my goals include continuous learning and career growth, with an adaptive approach to new technologies. Actively participating in the Power Users Community, I strive to contribute by solving queries and offering practical solutions through my blog. Beyond work, I find pleasure in reading novels, playing badminton, and engaging in E-Sports.
