    "shortDescription": "A **Puzzle a Day** is a clever twist on the classic tangram concept. You’re given 8 colorful, irregular shapes and a game board that resembles a 7×7 grid - but with a catch: some cells are blocked and unusable, which changes how the pieces fit. Your goal: place all the pieces so that they don’t overlap, and exactly two valid cells remain empty - one for the month, and one for the day.",

      "A **Puzzle a Day** is a clever twist on the classic tangram concept. You’re given 8 colorful, irregular shapes and a game board that resembles a 7×7 grid - but with a catch: some cells are blocked and unusable, which changes how the pieces fit. Your goal: place all the pieces so that they don’t overlap, and exactly two valid cells remain empty - one for the month, and one for the day. Behind the scenes, the entire game is powered by Named Formulas and User Defined Functions - a modern, maintainable approach to building logic in Power Apps. This design dramatically reduces code duplication, standardizes all calculations, and improves code redability by keeping the logic declarative and modular. Every shape move, rotation, or board update is calculated cleanly and efficiently."
