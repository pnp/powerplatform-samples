## Project Title
Mass Travel Solution

## Inspiration
Many travel companies collaborate with agencies worldwide to bring in clients, but managing these partnerships efficiently remains a challenge. There is no seamless system to track referrals, monitor client progress, or collect valuable feedback throughout the journey. As a result, companies struggle with inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and a lack of transparency in their referral processes. A well-integrated solution could streamline communication, provide real-time updates, and enhance collaboration between travel companies and agencies, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business outcomes.

## Solution

- MASS Travel Gateway (Power Pages) → Travel agencies update client status and interact with back-office. Customers submit new travel inquiries and post-travel feedback easily

- MASS Travel Hub (Model-Driven App) → Back-office team manages agencies, referrals, and reports



## Tech Stack
